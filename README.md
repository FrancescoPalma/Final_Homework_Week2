# Final_Homework_Week2
Basic Hotel app built in Ruby with OOP and TDD


# OO Weekend Homework

Requirements

Apply all the learning of the last two weeks to produce a TDD OO-designed application that models the operations of a hotel.

Single Hotel

1) We're going to need to model individual hotels, and their rooms -- they can have single or double-rooms. The hotel shold be able to tell us it's capacity. Rooms need to have a daily rate.

2) We also need guests. Guests need to be able check in to rooms at the hotel, and check out at the end of their stays.

3) Ensure we don't double-book rooms, or over-fill hotels.

4) The management are going to need reporting on the occupancy, and the revenue for a particular hotel (this can just be a running total don't worry about dates).

Further

- We've gone big time and have multiple hotels. We need occupancy reporting across all our hotels.

## A few Notes  
  
I found this app to be very challenging. As a result, I didn't manage to complete all the tasks.  
I completed almost 50% of the homework, in particular I found not difficult the task 1) and part of the task 2), 3).  
I spent a lot of time in designing and thinking of a potential working solution for 'check-in' & 'check-out' of the guests and for task 4)  
but my tests didn't pass and the solutions I was working on didn't convince me.  
Consequently, I decided to focus upon the first part of the homework and make the tests pass efficiently.  
I didn't investigate the 'Further' section at all.
